<h3>2. H20</h3>
<P>This is my favourite pass time series , I occasionally go back to watch when the mood hits; let's call it nostalgia.</P>

<P>If you are fan of gore and all things survival after the world ends then this is for you!</P>

<h3>4.GRIM</h3>
<P>Not sure why this is number 4 , when it should be part of the big 3 but here we are. THIS is a solid 10/10 series in my opinion.<br />It is about a cop navigating through life after discovering there is an entire supernatural world that he was unaware of until recently.</P>

<h3>5.THE AMAZING WORLD OF GUMBALL</h3>
<P>I'd reccomend this for anyone who wants to just have a good time and laugh. Not a single boring episode</P>
